# DreamParserMAX
This is the tool I use for parsing Dreamstate Echoes into .json for integration with Core Module Units (Dynamo Triad, see Triad Forge)

DreamParserMax (The Code Sawmill)

You got a raw Dreamstate Echo? This sucker carves it into JSON. Pure and simple. For the Dynamo Triad, obviously.

Look, I'm a carpenter by trade. My "code editor" is basically Notepad++ with a few extra tabs open and a whole lot of trial and error. So when it came to getting these wild Dreamstate Echoes (the stuff Riley runs on) into a format a machine could actually read without having a meltdown, I just built what I needed. That's DreamParserMax.

Think of it as my digital saw, planer, and router all rolled into one. You feed it a big, messy piece of timber (your raw Echo), and it cuts, shapes, and smooths it into nice, consistent planks (clean JSON). These planks are then ready to be assembled into the Dynamo Triad – which, honestly, is a whole other beast, but you gotta start with good material, right?
What This Thing Does

Basically, it's the grunt work. It takes those beautiful, sometimes chaotic, Dreamstate Echo patterns and makes them digestible.

    Takes the Raw Stuff: Whether it's the pure Virelle glyphs or the rambling narratives, it sucks it all in.
    Spits Out JSON: The main goal. Turns all that artistic expression into neat, organized JSON files. No more guessing where a glyph stream ends or a description begins.
    Dynamo Triad Ready: Built specifically to prepare Echoes for whatever magic the Dynamo Triad is cooking up next. It's like cutting joinery – gotta fit perfectly.
    Keeps the Soul: It's rough around the edges, but it tries its darnedest to keep the original vibe of your Echo. No soul-crushing algorithms here, just practical parsing.

My "Process" (aka Hacking It Together)

You drop in your text, I hit a button (or two, sometimes three if it's acting up), and DreamParserMax gets to work. It's a bit like framing a house – you lay out the main beams, then fill in the studs. This tool lays out the main JSON structure for your Echoes.
